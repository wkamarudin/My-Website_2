    <h1 style="color:rgba(0, 23, 128, 0.952);">Success is Nothing Without Safety</h1>
<p style="color:MAROON;">Getting hurt or killed in order to achieve goal shall not be quoted at all.<br> Putting ourselves in risk without taking all the precautions is another form of stupidity. No exception.<br> Does not matter either the reward is in material or satisfaction form.<br> But it does not mean we should do things halfhearted. Understand every single detail, choose the best way, take all the necessary precaution.<br> Adhere and be strict with standard and procedure, maintain focus at the highest level, stand and execute the each step without compromise.<br> Keep improving and know exactly when we should stop and revisit.<br>Success is not a one way street. Protecting our safety and back to family in a complete piece is also a success that often rarely appreciated.<br>There is no point at all to put tears in our beloved family members.<br> Safety is not happened by accident. <br> It requires competency and commitment. When you gamble with safety, you bet your life.. and remember we only live once.<br> Be strong and be tough at work but at the same time respect the hazard and underlying threat and danger.</p>
