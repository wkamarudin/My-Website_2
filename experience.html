<h2>Life Journey That Shape Us</h2>
<p>Life is mysterious. It makes people cry and laugh for a different reason. It is a journey forced on everybody to go through. No option.<br> It built from a combination of millions evens. The beautiful about this journey, we have no option in starting but we have absolute control in our action and in making choice. <br> We determined who we are and how we ended. <br> It is like a Power Turbine - Simple operation but complicated process..but the output is tremendous.</p>

<h3>Orang Minyak Joueney</h3>
<p>At beginning I did not choose to be an Orang Minyak. <br> I refused to go to university after SPM because I wanted to be a captain for a merchant ship.<br> My parents made their decision and deliver the message very effectively.. by giving a kind of look and without saying a word when I put the offer letter and scholarship agreement from Malaysia International Shipping Corporation (MISC) in front of them.<br> Today I am grateful of being an obedient son.</p>
<p>My mother magic word "I know you can do because you are my son" make me keep pedaling eventhough I cry in pain <br> Now I taste the fruit of the magic word.</p>

<p style="font-size:100%;">You can choose the path..but once it is taken the destination is fixed. <br> Be wise cause keep changing the path will slow you down.<br>Focus and determination is two things that only fitted with a man in mind and not a boy in action addition.</p>
